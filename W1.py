#Which concepts are in cluded in parameter(weight and biases) (never number of layers)
#perception: output can be either 1 or 0 , so 2 different values
# A neural network is called deep when L > 2 and shallow when L = 2. A neural network is narrow when its widths is in the same order of magnitude as its input size and wide when it has a layer that is significantly larger than the input size
#weight: 步数 parameters
#parameter amount: input and 节点 排列组合
